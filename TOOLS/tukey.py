    '''The Tukey window, also known as the tapered cosine window, can be regarded as a cosine lobe of width \alpha * N / 2
    that is convolved with a rectangle window of width (1 - \alpha / 2). At \alpha = 1 it becomes rectangular, and
    at \alpha = 0 it becomes a Hann window.
 
    We use the same reference as MATLAB to provide the same results in case users compare a MATLAB output to this function
